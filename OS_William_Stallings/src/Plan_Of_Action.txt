Comparative Study :

Write program for locks,semaphores,condition variables,monitors,synchronization using IPC send/receive.

Based On Above :

Using every primitive defined above.
Write programs for reader-writer, producer-consumer, dining philosopher.


Learnings :

Locks, Semaphore are basically built on top of basic instructions but there is logical difference between them.

Locks are owned(Ownership) by only one process at a time but that restriction doesnot apply to binary semaphore(No ownership).
Locks can be invoked multiple times by same owner as it's owned by him.
Locks are not initialized.  


mutexes : used for mutual exclusion (i.e. used for restricted access to the the resource, acquire and release necesarily done by same thread)

binary semaphore : can be used for above purpose as well as can be used for scheduling purposes
